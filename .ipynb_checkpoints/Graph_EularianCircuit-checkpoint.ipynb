    "There is a box protected by a password. The password is n digits, where each letter can be one of the first k digits 0, 1, ..., k-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can keep inputting the password, the password will automatically be matched against the last n digits entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assuming the password is \"345\", I can open it when I type \"012345\", but I enter a total of 6 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please return any string of minimum length that is guaranteed to open the box after the entire string is inputted.\n",

    "We can think of this problem as the problem of finding an Euler path (a path visiting every edge exactly once) on the following graph: there are k^(n-1)  nodes with each node having k edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when k = 4, n = 3, the nodes are '00', '01', '02', ..., '32', '33' and each node has 4 edges '0', '1', '2', '3'. A node plus edge represents a complete edge and viewing that substring in our answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any connected directed graph where all nodes have equal in-degree and out-degree has an Euler circuit (an Euler path ending where it started.) Because our graph is highly connected and symmetric, we should expect intuitively that taking any path greedily in some order will probably result in an Euler path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This intuition is called Hierholzer's algorithm: **whenever there is an Euler cycle, we can construct it greedily.** The algorithm goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Starting from a vertex u, we walk through (unwalked) edges until we get stuck. Because the in-degrees and out-degrees of each node are equal, we can only get stuck at u, which forms a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, for any node v we had visited that has unwalked edges, we start a new cycle from v with the same procedure as above, and then merge the cycles together to form a new cycle u→⋯→v→⋯→v→⋯→u.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with k = 2, n = 2, we have the nodes '0', '1'. If we greedily visit complete edges '00', '01', '10', we will be stuck at the node '0' prematurely. **However, if we visit in post-order, we'll end up visiting '00', '01', '11', '10' correctly.**"
